# Portfolio Website 1 (PHP)

This is my first never-completed portfolio project, first posted online on May 13, 2024. It’s a multilingual PHP website featuring a homepage, About Me, Impressum, and two additional unfinished pages. The site includes automatic language redirection based on the user’s system language. The background is animated, with minimal use of JavaScript.

This project served as an introduction to web development and digital content creation.
